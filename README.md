# Sales-Insights-using-MySQL and PowerBI

### Overview of the Project

The "Sales Insights Dashboard" project was designed to provide a computer hardware business with actionable insights to help it scale in a dynamically changing market. Leveraging Power BI and SQL, the project aimed to track revenue growth, year-over-year (YOY) trends, and region-wise sales performance. The result was an automated dashboard that significantly contributed to a 7% increase in sales revenue in the next quarter.

### About the Project
